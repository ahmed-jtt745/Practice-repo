# Tailwind CSS Practice Repo

This repository contains my **practice files for Tailwind CSS**.  
I created it to apply the concepts I’ve learned and build consistency by solving hands-on questions daily.  

Each question is solved in a separate HTML file (`Q1.html`, `Q2.html`, etc.) while sharing a single `output.css` file for Tailwind.  
The aim is to practice **responsive design, utilities, and component building** using Tailwind.

## Basic Questions to become familiar with classes

1. Create a div with background color, fixed width, height, and centered text. 
2. Style a heading with custom font size, weight, and letter spacing.
3. Make a square box with rounded corners and a shadow.
4. Add padding and margin variations (p-4, px-6, mt-10, etc.) to a div.
5. Build two boxes side by side using flex. 
6. Create a responsive image that is always centered.
7. Add hover effects on a button: change background, text color, and scale. 
8. Practice opacity + transition so an element fades smoothly on hover. 
9. Build a button with gradient background and rounded corners.
10. Create a card with border, padding, and shadow. 
11. Build a navbar with logo + links, stacked on mobile but horizontal on desktop.
